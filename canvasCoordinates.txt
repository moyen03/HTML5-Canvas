Canvas Coordinates:

The HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid. 
The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0)
In the canvasCoordinates.txt, We saw the method used: fillRect(0,0,200,100).
Means: Start at the upper-left corner (0,0) and draw a 200x100 pixels rectangle.

Draw a Line

To draw a straight line on a canvas, use the following methods:
moveTo(x,y) - defines the starting point of the line
lineTo(x,y) - defines the ending point of the line
To draw a line, We must use one of the "ink" methods, like stroke().

for example: 
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0,0);
ctx.lineTo(200,100);
ctx.stroke();

With a starting point in position (0,0), and an ending point in position (200,100). Then use the stroke() method to actually draw the line.

Draw a Circle

To draw a circle on a canvas, use the following methods:
beginPath();
arc(x,y,r,start,stop)

var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(95,50,40,0,2*Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
Where a circle with the arc() method. Then use the stroke() method to draw the circle.
